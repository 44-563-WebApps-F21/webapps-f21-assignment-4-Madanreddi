        _Drawing-room at Hunstanton_, _after dinner_, _lamps lit_.  _Door_ L.C.
        _Door_ R.C.

        [_Ladies seated on sofas_.]

        MRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
        little!

        LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?

        MRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.

        LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!

        MRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
        happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
        leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
        space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
        absolutely worn to shadows.

        LADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?

        MRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
        to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.
                
        LADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
        escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
        power and use it.
                
        LADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense
        all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
        place.
                
        MRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?
                
        LADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.
                
        MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they’re
        not married?
                
        LADY CAROLINE.  If they are not married, they should be looking after a
        wife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
        about society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry
        within twelve months.
                
        LADY STUTFIELD.  [_Refuses coffee_.]  But if they’re in love with some
        one who, perhaps, is tied to another?
        LADY CAROLINE.  In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off
        in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to
        meddle with other people’s property.

        MRS. ALLONBY.  I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other
        people’s property.  All men are married women’s property.  That is the
        only true definition of what married women’s property really is.  But we
        don’t belong to any one.

        LADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.

        LADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you really think, dear Caroline, that
        legislation would improve matters in any way?  I am told that, nowadays,
        all the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like
        married men.

        MRS. ALLONBY.  I certainly never know one from the other.

        LADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man
        has home claims upon his life or not.  I have noticed a very, very sad
        expression in the eyes of so many married men.

        MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly
        tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they
        are not.

        LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, I suppose the type of husband has completely
        changed since my young days, but I’m bound to state that poor dear
        Hunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.

        MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note; I’m tired of
        meeting him.

        LADY CAROLINE.  But you renew him from time to time, don’t you?

        MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh no, Lady Caroline.  I have only had one husband as yet.
        I suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur.

        LADY CAROLINE.  With your views on life I wonder you married at all.

        MRS. ALLONBY.  So do I.

        LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, I believe you are really very happy in
        your married life, but that you like to hide your happiness from others.

        MRS. ALLONBY.  I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest.

        LADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, I hope not, dear.  I knew his mother quite well.
        She was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland’s daughters.

        LADY CAROLINE.  Victoria Stratton?  I remember her perfectly.  A silly
        fair-haired woman with no chin.

        MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, Ernest has a chin.  He has a very strong chin, a
        square chin.  Ernest’s chin is far too square.

        LADY STUTFIELD.  But do you really think a man’s chin can be too square?
        I think a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should be
        quite, quite square.
